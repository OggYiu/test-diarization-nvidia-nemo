# Combined JSON Viewer Tab üîó

## Overview

The Combined JSON Viewer tab is a new feature in the Phone Call Analysis Suite that allows you to combine and view JSON results from multiple analysis tabs in a single unified JSON structure.

## Purpose

When you run multiple analyses (e.g., STT Stock Comparison and Transaction Analysis) on the same audio file or transcription, you may want to:

1. **Compare results side-by-side** - View all JSON outputs in one place
2. **Create unified reports** - Combine multiple analysis outputs into a single JSON file
3. **Export consolidated data** - Save all analysis results together for further processing or archival

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run Your Analyses

First, run your analyses in other tabs and copy their JSON outputs:

- **STT Stock Comparison Tab**: Copy the JSON from the "Structured Data (JSON)" textbox
- **Transaction Analysis Tab**: Copy the JSON from the "Pydantic JSON Ëº∏Âá∫" textbox
- Any other tab that produces JSON output

### Step 2: Navigate to Combined JSON Viewer Tab

Go to the "üîó Combined JSON Viewer" tab in the main interface.

### Step 3: Paste JSON Results

Paste each JSON result into the corresponding input boxes:
- **JSON Input 1**: First analysis result
- **JSON Input 2**: Second analysis result
- **JSON Input 3 (Optional)**: Third analysis result
- **JSON Input 4 (Optional)**: Fourth analysis result

### Step 4: Combine Results

Click the **"üîó Combine All JSON Results"** button.

The tool will:
- Validate each JSON input
- Automatically identify the type of analysis (Stock Extraction, Transaction Analysis, etc.)
- Combine all valid JSON into a unified structure
- Display a summary with metadata and source information

### Step 5: View and Save

- **Summary & Status**: Shows a high-level overview of combined results
- **Combined JSON Output**: Shows the complete unified JSON structure
- **Save to File**: Optionally save the combined JSON to a file

## Output Structure

The combined JSON follows this structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-31T12:34:56.789012",
    "total_sources": 2,
    "sources": ["Input 1", "Input 2"]
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "source_id": "source_1",
      "source_index": 1,
      "original_index": 1,
      "data": {
        // Original JSON from first analysis
      }
    },
    {
      "source_id": "source_2",
      "source_index": 2,
      "original_index": 2,
      "data": {
        // Original JSON from second analysis
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Features

### üì¶ Unified View
- Combines multiple JSON results into a single structured document
- Maintains original data integrity
- Adds metadata for tracking and organization

### üîç Automatic Type Detection
- Automatically identifies JSON types:
  - Stock Extraction (detects "stocks" field)
  - Transaction Analysis (detects "transactions" field)
  - General Analysis (detects "summary" field)
  - Custom Data (any other JSON structure)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
- Validates each JSON input
- Provides clear error messages for invalid JSON
- Continues processing valid inputs even if some are invalid

### üíæ File Export
- Save combined results as a JSON file
- Automatic filename generation with timestamp
- Customizable filename

### üïê Metadata
- Automatic timestamp generation
- Source tracking
- Total source count

### üìä Summary Display
- Clear overview of all combined sources
- Type identification for each source
- Quick statistics (number of stocks, transactions, etc.)

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Stock Extraction + Transaction Analysis

You transcribe an audio file using two different STT models and want to:
1. Extract stock information from both transcriptions (STT Stock Comparison)
2. Analyze transactions in both transcriptions (Transaction Analysis)
3. Combine both JSON results to see the complete picture

**Workflow:**
1. Run STT Stock Comparison ‚Üí Copy JSON output
2. Run Transaction Analysis ‚Üí Copy JSON output
3. Paste both in Combined JSON Viewer
4. Click "Combine All JSON Results"
5. View unified report showing both stock extraction and transaction analysis

### Use Case 2: Multiple Transaction Analyses

You have multiple audio files from different phone calls and want to:
1. Analyze each call separately (Transaction Analysis for each)
2. Combine all transaction analyses into one JSON file
3. Export for batch processing or reporting

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze Call 1 ‚Üí Copy JSON
2. Analyze Call 2 ‚Üí Copy JSON
3. Analyze Call 3 ‚Üí Copy JSON
4. Paste all three in Combined JSON Viewer
5. Save as single consolidated JSON file

### Use Case 3: Cross-Validation

You want to cross-validate results from multiple LLM models:
1. Run the same analysis with different LLM models
2. Combine all JSON results
3. Compare how different models identified stocks or transactions

## Examples

The tab includes two built-in examples:

### Example 1: Stock Extraction + Transaction
Demonstrates combining:
- Stock extraction result (stocks found)
- Transaction analysis result (buy/sell/queue transactions)

### Example 2: Multiple Transaction Analyses
Demonstrates combining:
- Three separate transaction analyses
- Different transaction types (buy, sell, queue)
- Various confidence scores

## Tips

1. **Always validate JSON first**: Make sure the JSON is valid before pasting (most analysis tabs provide valid JSON automatically)

2. **Use descriptive filenames**: When saving, use meaningful filenames like `customer_123_combined_analysis.json`

3. **Check the summary**: Review the summary to ensure all sources were processed correctly

4. **Empty inputs are OK**: You can leave input boxes 3 and 4 empty if you only have 2 results to combine

5. **Copy button available**: All textboxes have a copy button for easy copying of results

## Limitations

- Maximum 4 JSON inputs per combination
- Each input must be valid JSON or will be marked as error
- Large JSON files may take longer to process

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- Support for more than 4 inputs
- JSON comparison and diff view
- Filtering and searching within combined results
- Export to other formats (CSV, Excel)
- Visualization of combined data

## Technical Details

- **Technology**: Python 3.x, Gradio
- **JSON Processing**: Standard `json` module
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **File Encoding**: UTF-8 for proper Chinese character support

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues with the Combined JSON Viewer tab, please check:

1. Is your JSON valid? (Use a JSON validator online)
2. Are you pasting into the correct input boxes?
3. Check the Summary & Status for error messages
4. Ensure file write permissions if saving fails
