# Requirements for test-diarization project
# Core libraries
numpy>=1.24
librosa>=0.10
matplotlib>=3.7
pydub>=0.25
wget>=3.2
omegaconf>=2.3
scipy>=1.10

# Audio Enhancement
noisereduce>=2.0  # Optional but highly recommended for better noise reduction
torchaudio>=0.12.0  # Required for Highpass/Lowpass filters
soundfile>=0.12.1  # Required for audio I/O (avoids torchcodec dependency)
scipy>=1.10  # Required for audio filtering fallback

# NVIDIA NeMo (ASR / diarization)
# nemo_toolkit is not available on PyPI with full functionality and usually
# requires installation via pip from the NVIDIA index or by following
# NeMo installation docs. See notes below for recommended installation.

# Small helper for RTTM conversions (comes with NeMo):
# nemo_toolkit[all]  # Install using NeMo instructions (see notes)

# Notes / suggested install commands (do NOT put these lines in pip install):
# PyTorch (torch) is required at runtime. It's intentionally not pinned here
# because you must choose the correct wheel for your Python and CUDA setup.
# Examples (run in PowerShell):
#  - CPU-only (recommended if you don't have CUDA):
#      pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#  - CUDA (example for CUDA 11.8 - change cu118 to your CUDA version):
#      pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# After installing torch, install the rest of the requirements with:
#      pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# NVIDIA NeMo (ASR / diarization):
# Install NeMo after torch. Example (uses NVIDIA PyPI index):
#      pip install nemo_toolkit[all] --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
# If you only need specific NeMo collections (e.g., collections.asr), see the
# NeMo docs for minimal installation flags to reduce installed packages.

# Optional / dev
