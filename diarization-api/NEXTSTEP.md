# Next Steps for Improvement

To make the phone call analyzer program more accurate, here are the key areas we can work on:

## 1. Better Diarization: Explore NVIDIA NeMo Settings for Overlapping Voice

Currently, the diarization pipeline may struggle with overlapping speech segments where multiple speakers talk simultaneously. To improve this:

- **Explore NeMo's Overlapping Speech Detection**: NVIDIA NeMo provides advanced settings to handle speaker overlap scenarios
- **Configuration Parameters**: Investigate parameters like:
  - `overlap_infer_spk_limit`: Controls the maximum number of overlapping speakers to detect
  - `enhanced_count_thres`: Threshold for enhanced overlap detection
  - `collar`: Tolerance for speaker boundary detection
  - `ignore_overlap`: Whether to handle or ignore overlapping segments
- **Resources**:
  - [NeMo Speaker Diarization Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/asr/speaker_diarization/intro.html)
  - Experiment with different clustering methods (spectral vs. NME-SC)
  - Test with MSDD (Multi-scale Diarization Decoder) for better overlap handling

**Potential Impact**: Improved accuracy in phone recordings where both parties may talk over each other.

## 2. More Accurate STT: Fine-tune SenseVoiceSmall with Phone Recordings

The current STT model (SenseVoiceSmall) can be fine-tuned specifically for phone call audio characteristics to improve transcription accuracy.

### How to Get Started

- **Official Guide**: Start from the FunAudioLLM SenseVoice repository:  
  https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/SenseVoice?tab=readme-ov-file#finetune-1

- **Preparation Steps**:
  1. Collect and annotate phone recording datasets
  2. Prepare training data in the required format (audio + text transcriptions)
  3. Follow the fine-tuning guide to train on your domain-specific data
  
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Phone audio has specific characteristics: compressed codec, limited frequency range (typically 8kHz or 16kHz), background noise
  - Fine-tuning on real phone recordings will help the model adapt to these conditions
  - Consider adding augmentation (noise, compression) during training
  - Test with both sides of conversations (different voice characteristics, accents)

- **Expected Benefits**:
  - Better recognition of domain-specific terminology
  - Improved accuracy for accents and speech patterns in your recordings
  - Better handling of phone audio artifacts and noise

**Potential Impact**: Significantly higher transcription accuracy, especially for industry-specific terms and phone audio quality.

## 3. More Powerful LLM for Conversation Analysis

The current analysis pipeline can be enhanced by using more sophisticated reasoning models for deeper conversation understanding.

### Recommended Models

- **DeepSeek-R1:70B** (or similar high-level reasoning models)
  - Excellent at understanding Chinese language nuances
  - Advanced reasoning capabilities for complex conversation analysis
  - Can perform multi-step reasoning and inference

### Hardware Requirements

⚠️ **Important**: These large models require substantial VRAM:

- **Minimum**: 48GB of VRAM
- **Recommended Setup**: 2x NVIDIA RTX 5090 (32GB VRAM each) = 64GB total VRAM
- **Alternative**: Use cloud GPU services (AWS, Azure, RunPod, etc.) if local hardware is not available

### Implementation Considerations

- **Quantization**: Consider using quantized versions (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit) to reduce VRAM requirements
- **API Alternatives**: If local deployment is not feasible, consider using API services:
  - DeepSeek API (if available)
  - Other Chinese-optimized LLMs with API access
  
### Analysis Improvements

With a more powerful LLM, you can achieve:
- **Deeper sentiment analysis**: Understanding emotions and tones beyond basic classification
- **Intent recognition**: Identifying caller intent, concerns, and objectives
- **Key points extraction**: More accurate summarization of important conversation points
- **Context understanding**: Better grasp of implicit meanings and cultural context
- **Multi-turn reasoning**: Understanding conversation flow and relationships between different parts of the call

**Potential Impact**: Much richer insights from conversations, better understanding of customer needs, and more actionable analysis results.

## Priority Recommendations

Based on impact vs. effort:

1. **Start with #2 (STT Fine-tuning)**: Transcription accuracy is fundamental to all downstream tasks. Better transcriptions will improve all subsequent analysis.

2. **Then #1 (Diarization Improvement)**: This can be done with existing hardware and will help separate speakers more accurately.

3. **Finally #3 (Larger LLM)**: Consider this when you have access to sufficient hardware or API budget, as it provides the most sophisticated analysis but requires significant resources.
